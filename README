Gfire:
	Protocol Plugin (prpl) for Pidgin to send messages via XFire.

About
=====
Gfire 0.8.0 will need Pidgin 2.5.0 or higher because of all the new
features that are implemented. To compile it from source it will be
for most users easy as running:

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install

Read the INSTALL file for more information on compiling this package
correctly.

Please read the joingame in the doc/ dir for information on how to join 
your buddies in a game. And how to let gfire know how to update your
in game status.

Please read the UPGRADING text file for information about upgrading from
previous versions of the plugin.

After installation make sure you copy the data/gfire_games.xml to your purple
data directory. On unix this is .purple/ by default.

For joining games from gfire please read the README.joingame for more
information. You will need to create a gfire_launch.xml in your purple data
directory. An example is in the data/ directory. (The launch script is still a
bit buggy.)
